## Mass creating AD Users from a CSV

A script I created that allowed me to mass upload people to Active Directory for my work.

[You may freely utilize this script template.](https://github.com/TristenMaetzold/Powershell_Create_ADusers/blob/6b64f1aa8c847d673c9da01ee8d5a45a54e55af7/NewUser-PStoAD.ps1)

[This is the CSV template that was used to relate the data fields to a working variable. Feel free to edit this to your hearts content for your needs.](https://github.com/TristenMaetzold/Powershell_Create_ADusers/blob/1c4fced1eec7137a79c16aecfa5cd5a9e75dba6a/PS%20to%20AD%20Template%20Sheet1.csv)

## Enumerating ACL's

This script will fully enumerate ACL's in current directory.
